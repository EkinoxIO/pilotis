# pilotis
`pilotis` is the core package of an opinionated framework aiming at facilitating and accelerating
the creation of Data Science python applications, from prototyping till usage in production. More
specifically, `pilotis` allows you to :
* create a new python project from scratch, with a source and test package, a notebook repository, a data folder organization and a poetry virtual environment
* create a gitlab repository for your project with a preconfigured CI pipeline if needed
* provision an infrastructure on AWS if needed, with the same tools as in local
* access a library allowing you to easily load your data from S3 or local storage, with a common API

`pilotis` is currently hosted on gitlab, at https://gitlab.com/ekinox-io/ekinox-libraries/pilotis
